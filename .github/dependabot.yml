# =============================================================================
# Dependabot Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# Automatically checks for updates to:
# - GitHub Actions (weekly)
#
# SHA-pinned actions are updated while preserving the version comment.
# Example:
#   Before: uses: actions/cache@abc123 # v4.2.0
#   After:  uses: actions/cache@def456 # v4.2.1
#
# WHY USE DEPENDABOT FOR ACTIONS?
# -------------------------------
# 1. Security: Get notified of action updates (including security fixes)
# 2. Convenience: Automatic PRs with changelog
# 3. Safety: PRs allow review before merging
#
# IMPORTANT: Always review Dependabot PRs before merging.
# The tj-actions compromise showed that even "update" PRs can be vectors
# if the upstream is compromised.
